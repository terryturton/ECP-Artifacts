# Pantheon repository for ECP Artifacts
Pantheon aims to provide immutable, reproducible, and reusable experiment pipelines on target infrastructures. Each pipeline will produce at least one research artifact.
 
## Pantheon provides ...

- **A permanent working record of milestones**. These workflows serve both as records of milestone work, and examples for future work.
- **A set of reproducible workflow examples**. Creating ECP-based workflows is complex, so working examples are a valuable product. We provide these examples as records of milestones, examples for experimentation and learning, and records of functioning workflows.
- **Reproducibility for exploratory research**. Early software development efforts have unique build requirements and suffer from inconsistent versioning practices. The focus of Pantheon is to capture the state of a working experiment, to demonstrate a proof of concept. 

## Current Pantheon workflows

You'll find the current Pantheon workflows under the [artifacts directory](https://github.com/pantheonscience/ECP-Artifacts/tree/master/artifacts) in this repository. Each of the links there represent an individual recorded pipeline. Click on those links for more detailed information on each one.
